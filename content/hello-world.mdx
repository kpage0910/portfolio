Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog. I'm Kennedy, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on AI, problem-solving, and the journey of building things that matter.

## Why This Blog?

I started this blog because I believe in learning in public. My path in computer science wasn't traditional - I spent most of my degree unsure if I wanted to stick with it. It wasn't until my final semester that I discovered my passion for AI and machine learning.

## My Philosophy

I've learned that being a good problem solver is more important than being the smartest person in the room. My approach is simple:

1. **Identify real problems** that need solving
2. **Learn whatever is necessary** to solve them effectively
3. **Use AI and technology** as tools to create meaningful solutions
4. **Focus on impact** rather than just technical complexity

```javascript
// My coding philosophy in a nutshell
const approach = {
  mindset: "problem-solver first, programmer second",
  learning: "figure it out as you go",
  focus: "real-world impact",
  tools: ["AI", "code", "curiosity"],
};

console.log("Ready to build something meaningful!");
```

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- **AI and Machine Learning** - Projects, learnings, and insights
- **Problem Solving** - How I approach complex challenges
- **Learning Journey** - Lessons from building real projects
- **Tech Thoughts** - Opinions on tools, trends, and the future

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Let's build something amazing together!
