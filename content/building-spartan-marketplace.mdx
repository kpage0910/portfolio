When I started my capstone project, I wanted to build something that would actually solve a real problem for students at UNCG. That's how Spartan Marketplace was born - an AI-powered platform that makes buying and selling on campus as easy as taking a photo.

## The Problem

Students needed a better way to buy and sell items on campus. Existing solutions were either too generic (Facebook Marketplace) or too complicated for quick transactions. I wanted to create something that was:

- **UNCG-exclusive** - Only for our campus community
- **AI-powered** - Make listing items effortless
- **Community-focused** - Include discussions and connections

## The Solution

I built Spartan Marketplace with three core features:

### ðŸ¤– AI Marketplace Assistant

The standout feature is the AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 and Vision API. Students can:

- Upload a photo and get a complete listing generated automatically
- Search for items using natural language ("I need a cheap calculus textbook")
- Get smart recommendations based on their needs

### ðŸ’¬ Reddit-Style Community Board

Beyond just commerce, I added a community discussion board where students can:

- Ask questions about campus life
- Share tips and experiences
- Vote on helpful content
- Build connections

### ðŸ›’ Traditional Marketplace Features

For users who prefer the classic approach:

- Form-based listing creation
- Advanced search and filters
- Direct messaging between buyers and sellers
- Secure UNCG email verification

## Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Example of the AI listing generation
const generateListing = async (imageFile) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: "Generate a marketplace listing for this item. Include title, description, and suggested price.",
          },
          {
            type: "image_url",
            image_url: { url: imageFile },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content;
};
```

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React with modern hooks and context
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** Supabase for real-time data and auth
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4 and Vision API
- **Deployment:** Render for reliable hosting

## Key Learnings

### 1. AI Integration is About UX, Not Just Tech

The real challenge wasn't implementing the OpenAI API - it was designing an interface that made AI feel natural and helpful, not gimmicky.

### 2. Real Users Have Real Needs

Testing with actual UNCG students taught me that simplicity beats features every time. The photo-to-listing feature became the most loved because it solved a real pain point.

### 3. Community Matters

The discussion board ended up being just as important as the marketplace itself. Students wanted connection, not just transactions.

## What's Next?

This project taught me that the best technology solves real problems for real people. It's not about using the latest AI because it's cool - it's about making people's lives easier.

I'm continuing to apply these same principles to new AI-powered projects, always focusing on real-world problems that can benefit from thoughtful technology solutions.
