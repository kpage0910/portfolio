## 💡 Philosophy

I'm driven by the belief that being a good problem solver is more important than being the smartest person in the room. My approach is to:

1. **Identify real problems** that need solving
2. **Learn whatever is necessary** to solve them effectively
3. **Use AI and technology** as tools to create meaningful solutions
4. **Focus on impact** rather than just technical complexity
